# Overview

Firstly this repository serves as a single point of entry for all language-variants of the Syscoin API. All 
variants can be found in the [`/server` directory](/server). The variant officially supported by Blockchain Foundry, 
the primary developers of Syscoin is the NodeJS variant located in [`/server/nodejs`](server/nodejs). Deployment specifics can be found 
in the [README](server/nodejs/README.md) file relative to the desired variant (ie: `/server/nodejs/README`).

Secondly this repository allows users to generate various Syscoin-API server *and* client stubs based on the provided OpenAPI spec in 
swagger.yaml. They can then complete the implementation of the business logic (if working on the server side) within that variant and issue a pull 
request- for more information see the [Contributing](#contributing) section.

# Generating API

To generate the API first download [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) and build it. After its built, create an alias:

```
alias swagger-codegen='java -jar [/path/to/built/swagger-codegen]/swagger-codegen/modules/swagger-codegen-cli/target/swagger-codegen-cli.jar'
```

## Generating the JSON Spec 
Anytime the root swagger.yaml is modified the JSON spec should be updated and copied into 
`swagger-ui/dist/swagger-spec.js` as the value for the `swaggerSpec` var. Currently this is a manual process.

To regenerate the JSON API spec due to YAML changes (required for docs UI to be accurate): 

```
swagger-codegen generate -i swagger.yaml -o ./generated-json -l swagger
```
 
The generated JSON can be deleted after its been copied to `swagger-spec.js`.

## Generating Server Stubs
You can contribute to the syscoin-api project by writing connectors for Syscoin in different languages.
Swagger-codegen can greatly reduce the time it takes to write connectors in other languages by generating a server-api stub 
in the desired language. To generate the Server stub use the command below replacing LANGUAGE with one of the [supported SwaggerJS server values](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen/wiki/Server-stub-generator-HOWTO).

```
swagger-codegen generate -i swagger.yaml -o ./server/generated-server -l LANGUAGE
```

We encourage anyone who does this to submit a pull request to have their server API added to the official repo. Package your 
server API using folder names mirroring the swagger language name, ie: 'nodejs-server'. Client API's can also be submitted 
using the same format.

## Generating the Client SDK
To quickly start communicating with an instance of the Syscoin API server simply generate a client-side SDK 
in your preferred language. To generate the Client SDK use the command below replacing LANGUAGE with one of 
the [supported SwaggerJS client values](https://generator.swagger.io/#!/clients/clientOptions).

```
swagger-codegen generate -i swagger.yaml -o ./client/generated-client -l LANGUAGE
```

### Alternatively (particularly for syscoin)
We have added a script `./gen_client.sh` to generate client inside `/client` folder.

Make sure your `swagger-codegen-cli.jar` is built from the same version/commit mentioned in `/client/client/.swagger-codegen/VERSION`.  
Also update the `/client/client/.swagger-codegen/VERSION` if generated from a different version.

###### Arguments to pass to script  
client language: `typescript-angular`  
output directory: `generated-client`  
path to swagger-codegen-cli: `path to swagger-codegen-cli.jar`
